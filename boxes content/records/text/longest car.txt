A 30.5 m (100 ft) long 26-wheeled limousine was designed by Jay Ohrberg of Burbank, California, USA. It has many features, including a swimming pool with diving board and a king-sized water bed. It is designed to drive as a rigid vehicle or it can be changed to bend in the middle. Its purpose was for use in films and displays. Stretch limousines, the favoured means of transport for Hollywood stars, are not produced by any of the major motor manufacturers, but are made by coach builders who modify standard luxury vehicles. Specifications and levels of luxury vary accordingly. In the United States, vehicles by luxury car manufacturer Lincoln hold the biggest share of the market, although other marques such as Cadillac and Mercedes are also popular. Cadillac has redesigned its new DeVille models with limo conversions in mind, creating a chassis that can handle a 3 m (10 ft) stretch conversion. Typical rental rates for limousines vary between around US$50 and US$200 per hour.

Four technicians from tyre specialist Reifen Umert in Germany successfully changed all four wheels on a Ford Focus in less than a minute in 2015.

It took them precisely 58.43 seconds to complete the stunt, which included jacking the car up and using traditional hand-held wheel braces to remove the wheel nuts.
